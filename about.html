            <h1>Welcome to my corner of the web! üåç</h1>

            <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-prodan/" target="_blank">Alexandru Prodan</a>, and I'm a driven person with a passion for Quality Assurance (QA) and a growing interest in Automation Testing and Python. Having worked as a QA Tester for more than three years, I have developed my abilities to ensure product quality while maintaining my enthusiasm for programming.</p>

            <p>During my QA journey, I'm actively involved in daily scrum meetings and sprint planning sessions. I work closely with other teams throughout the Software Development Life Cycle, ensuring smooth collaboration. I'm dedicated to maintaining top-notch quality by conducting manual test runs on various systems and browsers. Additionally, I create comprehensive test documentation, including test plans and test cases.</p>

            <p>Apart from my work in Quality Assurance and coding for fun, I love learning and I am currently exploring the complexities of the German language. Playing video games  helps me relax, and hitting the gym keeps me motivated to stay fit. Traveling is another passion of mine, as it allows me to experience different cultures and viewpoints, sparking my imagination.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my website. Whether you're interested in collaboration opportunities or simply have questions, don't hesitate to reach out. üòÑ</p>
